                        Regular movement was equated with being healthy, while inactivity was seen as unhealthy (P8). Participants valued the All Activities metric because it provided a measurable representation of how much they moved. The focus was specifically on frequency and consistency rather than intensity of activities (P9). Regular physical activity had a positive impact on health. For P4, this was even reflected in an improvement of their chronic condition. Just like the number of workouts, the improvement in their condition could also be objectively identified through hard data.

                        Exercise was seen as something that boosted mood, created a sense of satisfaction, and helped manage mental balance (P1, P3, P5, P9). P1 emphasized that what matters most to them about being physically active is not necessarily the health benefit, but the positive feeling that comes with it. They made it clear that these emotional effects are their main motivation for engaging in physical activity.

This creates a downward spiral, where not feeling well mentally leads to inactivity, which in turn makes them feel worse.

                        Lastly, participants used their activity data to reflect on habits across different environments. P20 reflected on how their activities vary depending on their environment, such as hiking in Würzburg, going to the gym in Hamburg, or biking in [country]. Looking back at their activity data, they can trace these differences and see how location influences their routines. In this way, the All Activities metric becomes a personal journal of movement that reflects how they live in different places.

                       When considering Sleep in relation to health, participants focused on its effect on their bodies. High Sleep scores were interpreted as indicators of good physical health (P18), and consistent sleep patterns contributed to a healthy lifestyle (P9, P8). Moreover, sleep was described as a necessary factor for physical recovery. Getting sufficient rest consistently enables the body to repair itself, which leads to good health.

While it was clear to participants that inconsistency and short sleep duration had a negative effect on their health, the effect of little sleep on well-being was not directly inferable without knowing the context. P12 pointed out that missing sleep due to a fun activity could still result in high well-being, while missing sleep due to stress would likely reduce it.

Much like sleep, stress was experienced first as a feeling and only later as a measurable health risk. However, participants’ interpretations often conflicted with Garmin’s Stress metric, which is based on physiological indicators like HRV. This mismatch led some to doubt the metric’s accuracy, especially when values contradicted their subjective experience, however still remained meaningful to many.

                       Heart Rate was viewed as a direct measure of one's physical condition, with clear thresholds for what is considered healthy. This aligned with participants' understanding of health as something quantifiable. This directness made it a particularly trusted health metric.

According to P3, looking at the Heart Rate metric allows for a direct distinction between fit and less fit individuals:

                       Garmin distinguishes between two heart rate metrics in its interface: Resting Heart Rate and Maximum Heart Rate. For participants, it was primarily Resting Heart Rate that was meaningful in assessing their health status. Once again, the participants were able to draw direct conclusions about their health from the figures. A low resting heart rate indicated that the body is fit and, therefore, healthy.

                       Resting Heart Rate also enabled participants to identify when their bodies were sick or engaging in unhealthy behavior. P9, for example, observed a noticeable increase in their resting heart rate following alcohol consumption. P5 reported that their COVID-19 infection was reflected in changes to their resting heart rate:

                       While a high resting heart rate was seen as a sign of poor health, a large difference between resting heart rate and maximum heart rate was seen as a sign of good health, as P14 stated:

                       While there was agreement among participants that Resting Heart Rate served as a reliable indicator of physical fitness and overall health, the interpretation of Maximum Heart Rate proved to be much more inconsistent. P18 claimed that a low maximum heart rate was a sign of good health, while P15 thought it was a high maximum heart rate, and P8 assumed that it would be healthy for the heart to be pushed higher than that sometimes. Overall, participants showed difficulty in assessing their health status based solely on Maximum Heart Rate values:

                       Participants interpreted heart rate differently for health and well-being. For health, it was seen as an objective indicator of physical state (e.g., a low resting heart rate signaled fitnes). For well-being, heart rate data required context, as participants linked changes to specific experiences or emotions. Exercise-related increases were often viewed positively as signs of engaging in enjoyable activity, while sudden spikes were sometimes tied to negative feelings.

Unlike health, where the numbers spoke for themselves, well-being required contextual recall to draw conclusions.

For instance, P10 observed that their Fitness Age would drop by a few years during particularly relaxed periods. This, to them, reflected a time of higher well-being.

P14 described how having a younger Fitness Age provided a boost to their well-being because it felt good to be seen as younger than their actual age:

Similar to Heart Rate, conclusions about the well-being status were possible if the periods considered could be linked to memories of periods of better or worse well-being. In addition, seeing a younger Fitness Age was seen as a compliment, which had a direct positive influence on well-being.

                       Body Battery was most often interpreted as a well-being metric, with three-quarters of participants categorizing it as such. Its focus on overall energy, which was often derived from sleep, stress, and activity, aligned closely with their view of well-being as a holistic sentiment shaped by multiple factors and linked to mental state.

                       Body Battery reflects the balance between recovery and exertion for the participants. They explained that it recharges through sleep and drops through stress and physical activity. When they saw that their Body Battery started low, it typically signaled to them that they had not slept enough or that their sleep had been poor. This, in turn, led them to conclude that their well-being was likely lower as a result.

                       However, participants also noted that whether a drop in Body Battery was good or bad for their well-being depended on the reason for the decrease. For example, P18 described that using up all their energy in a day could feel satisfying. On the other hand, P19 explained how their Body Battery drops when their Stress levels rise, which is a negative reason for a decrease in Body Battery.

                    <div class="narrative-paragraph">
                       Furthermore, participants described how a low Body Battery was linked to low well-being and a high Body Battery to high well-being, overall. P8 explained that when their Body Battery did not rise above a certain level, they felt tired and their well-being suffered. On the other hand, when their Body Battery was high, they felt better, and their well-being was stronger.

                    <div class="narrative-paragraph">
                       In terms of health, the metric was used to understand sleep and activity patterns. For instance, P19 interpreted that a healthy Body Battery does not always stay high. Instead, it should drop during the day from activity, which reflects healthy physical movement, and recharge overnight, which indicates good recovery.

                            "A healthy Body Battery doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s always high, because if it’s always high, that also means you’re not really using your body or anything. So a high Body Battery... good health would mean that you recharge well at night, so that your body, when it’s at rest, recharges properly, but that you also drop low during the day from exercising, because that makes it go down, moving makes it go down, but your sleep... yeah, exercise is healthy, and good sleep is healthy too, and that makes it recharge again." -P19
                        </div>

                    <div class="narrative-paragraph">
                       In line with this, P19 noted that a consistently low Body Battery could suggest illness or an unhealthy lifestyle:

                    <div class="narrative-paragraph">
                       In summary, participants viewed Body Battery primarily as a reflection of mental state, making it especially relevant for well-being, which they defined in emotional terms. For health, the metric was interpreted more indirectly through its components (sleep, activity, and recovery) rather than as an immediate, felt experience.

However, P7 noted that Intensity Minutes can also come from physical labor, for example, at work, and not just from planned workouts. They questioned whether high intensity at work is good in the same way as during sports, suggesting that the context of how the intensive physical activity was performed mattered too.

                       Participants saw their step count as a simple indicator of how physically active they are throughout the day, which they viewed as a crucial part of overall health. P6 and P17 discussed how the job type strongly influences their daily step count. Physically active jobs naturally lead to higher step counts and less need for additional exercise, while desk-based jobs require more conscious effort to stay active, and thus healthy.

Participants explained that seeing a period with very few steps would likely mean they had moved less and worked more, which they associated with lower well-being. P7 reflected on how being indoors too much led to negative feelings. They saw walking, especially outdoors, as a way to counter these feelings.

Too little weight, on the other hand, would also be harmful to health. They felt it was important to look at what the weight is made of: muscle vs. fat, and how it fits with their body type.

                       For participants who interpreted weight in terms of well-being, there was a clear consensus that being overweight could diminish their well-being. They described how carrying excess weight impacted their ability to move comfortably and engage in activities that would otherwise contribute positively to how they felt mentally. P11 explained that weight could influence well-being by making everyday physical tasks more exhausting and uncomfortable:

Seeing only one summarizing number for their weight, which does not distinguish between fat and muscle, triggered their awareness. Participants had to think about where weight changes could come from, whether they had been working out or simply eating more, to help them make sense of what the weight meant for their well-being.

This experience confirmed that the metric can reflect physical changes in the body. However, they only recognized the data as meaningful because they already knew they had been sick. Without that context, they would not have been able to interpret whether the Respiration metric indicated they were healthy or not.

                       The HRV Status was used as an indicator of health. Not all participants had access to this data, but those who mentioned this metric knew what HRV Status could reveal about their health status. Seeing higher HRV values, within a certain range, reassured participants that their body is in a good state physically.

                       HRV Status was also considered a warning sign for overtraining (P5) and sickness. For example, P5 described how changes in their HRV Status predicted illness before symptoms appeared:

What made this interpretation meaningful for them was that they could link the data to a specific day when they remembered that they were not feeling well. They observed that during this time, their HRV Status was also lower. By connecting their memory of their feelings to the data points, they were able to infer how their well-being was reflected in the values for HRV Status.

                       Participants who looked at the Pulse Ox metric mostly understood that higher blood oxygen levels are better and connected this to overall health. However, their knowledge of the details of the metric was limited. P8 said blood oxygen should be high enough to think clearly, and purposely measuring Pulse OX during sleep, where it might reveal conditions like sleep apnea. P17 admitted they did not fully understand why blood oxygen levels matter, but assumed that more oxygen equals being healthy, and low oxygen levels could indicate sickness. Another participant relied on the color coding provided by Garmin to interpret the data (P14).
